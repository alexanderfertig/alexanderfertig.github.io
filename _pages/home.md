I am a PhD Candidate in Economics and [Public Policy](https://fordschool.umich.edu/phd){:target="_blank"} at the University of Michigan, and a Graduate Fellow in the Demography Training Program at the Population Studies Center ([PSC](https://psc.isr.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"}). My research interests are in development economics, political economy, and labor economics. In my job market paper, I study the effects of internet access on political conflict, and whether these effects can help or harm resistance movements. I also work on topics related to international migration, women's economic empowerment, and the long-run impact of reparations.

I previously worked as a Research Manager with Innovations for Poverty Action ([IPA](https://poverty-action.org/){:target="_blank"}) in Namibia and Myanmar, where I managed Randomized Controlled Trials of policy interventions for local government and NGOs. I have a BA in Mathematics and Economics from Wesleyan University and an MPA from Columbia University.

**I am on the 2025--2026 Job Market and available for interviews.**
