I am a PhD Candidate in Economics and [Public Policy](https://fordschool.umich.edu/phd){:target="_blank"} at the University of Michigan, and a Graduate Fellow in the Demography Training Program at the Population Studies Center ([PSC](https://psc.isr.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"}). My research interests are in development and labor economics, with a focus on international migration. Specifically, I am interested in patterns of short-term labor migration, and understanding how migration decisions shape origin-country development through remittances, information networks, and labor market changes.

I previously worked as a Research Manager with Innovations for Poverty Action ([IPA](https://poverty-action.org/){:target="_blank"}) in Namibia and Myanmar, where I managed Randomized Controlled Trials of policy interventions for local government and NGOs. I have a BA in Mathematics and Economics from Wesleyan University and an MPA from Columbia University.
